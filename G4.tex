\chapter{Heuristic Evaluation}
A heuristic evaluation was carried out during the February 26th CSC318 tutorial in order to assess conformity of our application to the 5 usability heuristics we have identified as important. This evaluation employed 5 expert evaluators who were asked to complete 2 pre-determined task on paper prototypes and provide feedback based on the 5 heuristics.

\section{Rationale}
Our rationale for using a heuristic evaluation is that the feedback provided by these expert evaluators would yield a greater benefit with a small number of participants leading to decreased time spent. \footnote{As seen on slide 34 in Lecture 6: Usability Principles \& Heuristic Evaluations}

\section{Participants}
We recruited 5 expert evaluators from our CSC318 course at the University of Toronto. These evaluators are male between the ages of 20 to 25. Four of the evaluators are on their way to completing a Computer Science major/specialist, one did not disclose his information. It is important to note that all evaluators are comfortable using a smartphone, as they all own a smartphone, with 2 of the 5 evaluators running iOS on their smartphone, and the rest running an android operating system. These expert evaluators are also quite familiar with heuristic evaluations and are comfortable with the 5 usability heuristics that were explained to them at the start of the usability task.

\section{Usability Criteria}

To carry out the heuristic evaluation we first presented the evaluators with a description of the 5 usability criteria and how they would be important to our application. These criteria are as follows:
\vspace{0.7cm}

\noindent\textbf{[Consistency and Standards]}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\\The icons and actions that are available must be consistent with what the user thinks
the resulting action should be. The icons and actions should also have uniform
meaning throughout the use of the application and relate to the current platform
so as not to confuse the user and to make available actions recognizable.
\pagebreak
\\\textbf{[Flexibility and Efficiency]}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\\The application must have the ability to customize interaction in order to conform
to the current user. Implementation of this is important in order to have quick user
response times and to accommodate all types of users.
\vspace{0.7cm}
\\\textbf{[Error Prevention]}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\\With a restricted set of actions and the ability to edit data, we can ensure that
the user is never confronted with any form of error. While the data input is up to
the users themselves, the app should always provide means of editing data and to
limit choices, for example with the use of radio buttons. Keeping the data collection
methods consistent prevents the application from raising any form of error.
\vspace{0.7cm}
\\\textbf{[Visibility of System Status]}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\\The user should always know of the current status of the application and what
actions are available at that time. Properly titled pages along with current system
readiness, such as an hourglass to indicate that the system is working or busy, will
let the user know what is happening at that very moment.
\vspace{0.7cm}
\\\textbf{[Aesthetic and Minimal Design]}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\\Eliminating unnecessary actions and icons can reveal what the user is able to do at
that moment in time. Since the interface will have a reduced number of actions, it is
relatively easy to keep the screen visually pleasing and at the same time informative,
letting the user know that the only available actions are the ones seen on the screen.

\section{Tasks}
The evaluators were then asked to complete 2 tasks on the paper prototypes. The evaluators were presented with the home screen at the start of each task, and simulation of the task occurred via the evaluator's interaction with the "buttons" on the protoype. Tapping on the keyboard button allows the evaluator to simulate typing on the screen, and tapping on action buttons would present the evaluator with another screen prototype. \footnote{The screen prototypes can be found in the Appendix} The tasks given are as follows:
\vspace{0.7cm}
\\\textbf{Task 1:} Log into the application, get to the log entry screen and complete an entry.
This is performed by tapping on application icon shown in \textit{Screen 1}, inputting a password
if necessary (the details for the password are already given) or choosing a user that does
not have a password (seen in \textit{Screen 4}) and by clicking Add New shown in \textit{Screen 5}. From here it brings the user to the entry screen as seen on \textit{Screen 6} where the user can input data and confirm their entry by clicking OK as seen on \textit{Screen 7}.
\vspace{0.7cm}
\\\textbf{Task 2:} Create a custom category to add to the log entry screen. From the home screen
\textit{Screen 5}, the user should click the Settings icon on the top right-hand corner which will
bring them to \textit{Screen 10}. Users should then click Change Log (bringing them to \textit{Screen 12}) and then click Create New.

\section{Rationale}
\section{Tasks}
\section{Participants}

\chapter{Think-aloud Evaluation}
A think aloud is a very straightforward process that requires only a participant and the paper prototype for the application. It involves the participant executing a given task while giving verbal feedback of all actions and thoughts encountered. For a think aloud, speech throughout the entire task is encouraged and needed to gather accurate, user-perspective data. In order for the participants to be comfortable with verbalizing their actions and their thoughts, we provide a few practice sessions involving objects not related to the application in order for them to get used to speaking their actions.

To ensure an accurate presentation of the think aloud for each participant, we have generated a script that will be presented to each participant. The script consists of a basic description that is given to all participants along with practice tasks that can be given until the participant is comfortable with thinking out loud. The practice sessions use a basic calculator since it is an object that most people are familiar with. The familiarity will help users be confident of their actions and pick up the task more readily. The think aloud itself will only require the paper prototype.

Think Aloud Protocol Script
\\``We are currently working on a health application and would like to see how you interact with the current features. We ask that you say all your actions out loud and the thought process behind your actions. For practice we will have you perform simple calculator operations and have you say everything you are thinking including why you chose what button''
\\
``Calculate 57.3 times 1900''\\
``Calculate 40\% of 360''\\
``Type ‘hello’''\\
``Calculate 0.4 divided by 52''\\
If user is not actively describing their actions, encourage speech with ``don't forget to describe what you're doing'' or ``remember to think out loud''.

\section{Rationale}
Performing a think aloud is suitable for our application's current state since it allows us to gather data without needing any additional equipment; only the paper prototype and a participant is required. Also, since this method is quick and easy to perform, we are able to gather numerous participants and keep explanation of the task at hand to a minimum.
\section{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sign in using existing user
\item Make a new log entry
\item View previous log entries
\item Change inputs for the log
\item Edit profile
\end{itemize}
\section{Participants}
The participants gathered for the think aloud varied in age: three of the five participants were aged 20-25 and the remaining two were between 40 and 45. The evaluators between the ages of 20 and 25 are currently attending post-secondary institutions while the remaining evaluators are currently working full time. All participants do own and operate smart phones, but only do so for their basic features. This implies that the users know basic smart phone maneuvering, but are not “experts” in any one task. None of the participants were previously exposed to the application in any form and will be seeing it for the first time while doing the think aloud
